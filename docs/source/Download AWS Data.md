# Download AWS Data

We have permission to host only **1-day sample data** for each network, which can be downloaded from this 
[webpage](http://jaws.ess.uci.edu/jaws/sample_data/). There is one file for each network on the webpage. 
The file name is prefixed by network name. To save a file, right click on the file name and select "Save link as".

```
Important Note:

For PROMICE, input file name must contain station name. 
e.g. 'PROMICE_KAN-B.txt' or 'KAN-B.txt' or 'Kangerlussuaq-B_abc.txt', etc.

For IMAU, input file name must start with network type(i.e. 'ant' or 'grl'), 
followed by a underscore and then station number. 
e.g. 'ant_aws01.txt' or 'ant_aws15_123.txt' or 'grl_aws21abc.txt', etc.

```
